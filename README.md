# Walmart Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's sales data to gain insights into sales patterns, factors influencing sales performance, and predictive modeling for sales forecasting. The analysis includes statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier analysis, and predictive modeling techniques.

## Problem Statement

Walmart, a retail store with multiple outlets, faces challenges in managing inventory to match demand with supply. The objective is to utilize data-driven insights to understand sales patterns, identify factors affecting sales, and forecast future sales accurately.

## Data Description

The dataset contains historical sales data of 45 Walmart stores, including features such as store number, weekly sales, date, holiday flag, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate.

## Analysis Overview

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and preprocess for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data characteristics, outliers, and correlations.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests and analyze stationarity.
4. **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose sales data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Train and evaluate predictive models such as Random Forest Regressor, ARIMA, and SARIMA for sales forecasting.

## Methodology

- **Importing Important Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Prophet.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Outlier analysis, correlation analysis, scatter plots, and bar plots.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose sales data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate predictive models for sales forecasting.

## Inferences and Insights

The analysis provides insights into factors influencing sales performance, seasonal trends, and predictive modeling accuracy. Recommendations for future exploration and enhancement of predictive capabilities are also provided.

## Future Possibilities and Recommendations

Future iterations could explore additional factors, advanced machine learning techniques, and dynamic pricing strategies for enhanced predictive capabilities and strategic planning.

## Conclusion

The Walmart sales analysis offers valuable insights into sales patterns, factors affecting sales, and predictive modeling for sales forecasting. By leveraging data-driven approaches, Walmart can optimize sales strategies and foster long-term growth.
